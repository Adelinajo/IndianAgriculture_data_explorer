# IndianAgriculture_data_explorer
   Indian Agriculture plays a major role to the country's growth and economy.Its challenging due to unpredicted weather conditions,inefficient resource management,soil degradation and other factors affects productivity. This projects aim to analysis the agriculture data using Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and Power BI to identify key pattern,trends and insights about crop yield, farmer-decision-making and resources allocation. Data Preprocessing such as handling missing and NAN values is carried out as first step.Second step is EDA,It is done by identifying trend in crop and area yield, patterns and correlations between crops.In Power BI the EDA visualization is done by calculating its Total production for each crop and also converting them into Kg from tons using measures and graph is plotted for the same. Next step is cleaned dataset is loaded to mysql.Now we connect MySQL with PowerBI by giving server name and database name. Queries are written and the graph is plotted for the same .
